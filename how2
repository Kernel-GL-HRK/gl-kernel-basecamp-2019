														Instruction

For the lazy:
1.Start script
2.PROFIT

For step-by-step testing:

1.Start assembly your module by 
make M ="Path/to/your/module/directory"
2. Use command to load module into kernel 
"insmod module_name.ko"
You can choose buffer size for module by 
"insmod module_name.ko B_size=your size" 
....or dont write B_size=your size and buffer will be 1kB default.
3.read content of buffer by command 
cat /proc/module_name
4.write something into buffer with command
 echo  "something" > $/proc/module_name
5.check non-empty buffer again by 
cat /proc/module_name
6.delete all from buffer by 
echo 1 > /sys/kernel/your_path_to_file
7.check buffer again by 
cat /proc/module_name
8. cat command can't show exact content of buffer, so use test prorgam from addition, but assemble it firstly:
gcc testrw.c -o testread_dev
Then execute
/test_file_path/testread_dev
9.remove module from kernel by
rmmod module_name
